# [Duck Duck Go Game](https://khadkaankit85.github.io/QuackQuackGo/)

- **Responsive Design**: The game adapts to different screen sizes for a better mobile experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution.
